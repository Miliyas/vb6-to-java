# Introduction #

The goal of this application is to translate Microsoft Visual Basic version 6 code to Java code.

The code related to describe the interface (all the code located in forms before the keyword Attribute) will be ignored by this tool. The tool will translate only Visual Basic code, not interface definition code.

The resulting code is not supposed to be ready to compile. The application tries to help the programmer to translate the 90% of the code. The programmer has to translate the harder parts.

# How to Use #

Download the last compiled version from

http://code.google.com/p/vb6-to-java/downloads/list
